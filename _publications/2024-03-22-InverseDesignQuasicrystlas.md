excerpt: 'This paper explores the inverse design of crystals and quasicrystals in a non-additive binary mixture of hard disks. 
To locate the necessary state points and physical parameters where self-assembly for (quasi)crystals occurs, we employed an inverse design technique. 
Essentially, we solve a black box optimization (BBO) problem using an evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES).
In the paper we utilize two different fitness functions. First of all a CNN, secondly a new symmetry-based order parameter.'
